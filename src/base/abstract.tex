Mobile devices are becoming an integral part of our everyday lives. And it is only normal that the need to protect the sensitive data stored on them increases along with this integration. Android is a Linux based operating system for such devices. With its support for multiple user accounts on the same device came the necessity to protect each user's data separately. This project addresses that issue.

The solution presented in this thesis is based on technology from the Linux world, building a system for multi-user encryption on top of an existing file protection solution.

\textbf{Keywords:} Android, encryption, Linux, multi-user, privacy.
